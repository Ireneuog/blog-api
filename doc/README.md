# Intelligent CI/CD Pipeline with AI-Augmented Quality Gates

## Team
- Sofia Ortiz (Product Owner – Sprint 1)
- João Pereira
- Irineu Hiva

## Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement an intelligent CI/CD pipeline that automates the main stages of the software delivery process—build, test, and deploy—while integrating AI-driven quality gates for code quality, testing, and security validation.

## Planned Technologies
- Node.js + Express
- Docker + Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD automation)
- CodeQL (Static Application Security Testing – SAST)
- OWASP ZAP (Dynamic Application Security Testing – DAST)
- AI-based tool (e.g., ChatGPT API, CodiumAI, or SonarQube AI)
- Jira (Agile and Scrum project management)

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
